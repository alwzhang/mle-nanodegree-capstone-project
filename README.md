# Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Capstone Project
In this capstone project, you will leverage what youâ€™ve learned throughout the Nanodegree program to solve a problem of your choice by applying machine learning algorithms and techniques. You will first **define** the problem you want to solve and investigate potential solutions and performance metrics. Next, you will **analyze** the problem through visualizations and data exploration to have a better understanding of what algorithms and features are appropriate for solving it. You will then **implement** your algorithms and metrics of choice, documenting the preprocessing, refinement, and postprocessing steps along the way. Afterward, you will collect **results** about the performance of the models used, visualize significant quantities, and validate/justify these values. Finally, you will construct **conclusions** about your results, and discuss whether your implementation adequately solves the problem.
